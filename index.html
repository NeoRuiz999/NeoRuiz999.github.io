      Dear Mom,<br/>
      I want to let you know that I appreciate you and all of the sacrafices you've made for us. You do so much for us every day to make sure we are happy and have what we need to live.
      You always put us before yourself although I wish you would do more for yourself. You deserve to be happy too. You're doing it all on your own and for that you're really strong.
      No other mother in the world compares to you in the way you care for and love your kids. We are truly lucky to have you and I will never forget everything you have done for us.
      I will forever be grateful of all the memories together and never will I stop loving you. You're the greatest thing in my life, and the one person I know I will always have.
      If I ever need anything I know I can count on you to be there. And I'll always be here for you too. Thank you for never giving up on us no matter how bad things have gotten.
      Thank you for all the love you've shown us, and thank you for being our Mom. Happy Mother's Day. ❤️
  </p></div></div>
